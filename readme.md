You will be working in two folders for this practice exercise (test, functions).

In the functions folder you will find a file named yourFunctions.js. Here you will write functions that will meet the expectations of the tests found in /test/ourTests.js

In the test folder you will find a file named yourTests.js. Here you will write tests that will meet the needs of the functions that can be found in functions/ourFunctions.js


### **Make sure to remove the x from each test you plan on testing. For example xit => it**

### To run your tests use command: npm run test
### To check test coverage use command: npm run coverage
